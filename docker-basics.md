# Docker basics

<small>Docker wraps container technology in an easily consumable package</small>

<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<div class="col">
## Images &#x1F304;

* A compiled, distributable package

</div>
<div class="col">
### Containers &#x1F4E6;

* A running instance, started from an image
* When started, has a state identical to the image
* Any changes to state are local to the container

</div>
</div>
</div>

Note:

Later, we will show how we can keep state

I often confuse "image" and "container"
